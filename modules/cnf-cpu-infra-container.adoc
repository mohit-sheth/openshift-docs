= Restricting CPUs for infra and application containers

You can reserve cores (threads) from a single NUMA node for operating system housekeeping tasks and put your workloads on another NUMA node. Partitioning the CPUs this way can prevent the housekeeping processes from impacting latency-sensitive application processes. By default, CRI-O uses all online CPUs to run infra containers on nodes, which can result in context switches and spikes in latency. 

You can ensure that housekeeping tasks and workloads run on separate NUMA nodes by specifying two groups of CPUs in the `spec` section of the performance profile. 

* `isolated` - The CPUs for the application container workloads. These CPUs have the lowest latency. Processes in this group have no interruptions and can, for example, reach much higher DPDK zero packet loss bandwidth.

* `reserved` - The CPUs for the cluster and operating system housekeeping duties, including pod infra containers. Threads in the `reserved` group tend to be very busy, so latency-sensitive applications should be run in the `isolated` group. See link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/#create-a-pod-that-gets-assigned-a-qos-class-of-guaranteed[Create a pod that gets assigned a QoS class of `Guaranteed`].

.Procedure

. Create a performance profile that is appropriate for your hardware and topology.

. Add the `reserved` and `isolated` parameters with the CPUs you want reserved and isolated for the infra and application containers:
