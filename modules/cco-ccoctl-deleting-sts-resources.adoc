= Deleting AWS resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

To clean up resources after uninstalling an {product-title} cluster with the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) in manual mode with STS, you can use the CCO utility (`ccoctl`) to remove the AWS resources that `ccoctl` created during installation.

.Prerequisites

* Extract and prepare the `ccoctl` binary.
* Install an {product-title} cluster with the CCO in manual mode with STS.

.Procedure

* Delete the AWS resources that `ccoctl` created:

----
$ ccoctl aws delete --name=__<name>__ --region=__<aws_region>__
----
+
where:
+
** `_<name>_` matches the name used to originally create and tag the cloud resources.
** `_<aws-region>_` is the AWS region in which cloud resources will be deleted.
