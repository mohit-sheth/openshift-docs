= Configuring managed Secure Boot in the `install-config.yaml` file (optional)

To enable managed Secure Boot, add the `bootMode` configuration setting to each node:

[source,yaml]
.Example
----
hosts:
  - name: openshift-master-0
    role: master
    bmc:
      address: ipmi://<out-of-band-ip>
      username: <user>
      password: <password>
    bootMACAddress: <NIC1-mac-address>
    rootDeviceHints:
     deviceName: "/dev/sda"
    bootMode: UEFISecureBoot <1>
----

<1> The `bootMode` setting is `UEFI` by default. Change it to `UEFISecureBoot` to enable managed Secure Boot.

[NOTE]
====
See "Configuring nodes" in the "Prerequisites" to ensure the nodes can support managed Secure Boot. If the nodes do not support managed Secure Boot, see "Configuring nodes for Secure Boot manually" in the "Configuring nodes" section. Configuring Secure Boot manually requires Redfish virtual media.
